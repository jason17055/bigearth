User interface improvements
- Track building UX should change so that as you click and hold the mouse, the
  UI will recalculate the shortest route to where you dragged to, and only place
  the tracks when you release the button.
- Allow Current Demands to stay on the screen while placing track or moving the
  train.
- Move Show Players dialog to left side, and allow it to stay on the screen
  (appearing above Current Demands) even while Current Demands and other UI
  elements are on the screen.
- When zooming out to show a selected demand, don't zoom out any further than
  needed to show all source cities and the destination.

Game play improvements:
- Have demands provide more reward for harder-to-achieve deliveries.
- Have demands expire somehow.
- Idea: have completed demands come back in future games (or later in the same
  game) with smaller rewards, and have expired demands come back in future games
  with larger rewards.
- Have using other player's track cost money. Avoid using other player's track
  if possible when routing trains.
